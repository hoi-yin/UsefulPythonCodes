1. Recursion, While and For loops (Standard Example Formats. Can be modified and changed as needed)

A. Recursion
def recursion(A,n):
    if n==1:
        return A
    elif n>1:
        return recursion(A,n-1)

def recursion(A,n):
    //Terminating Condition//
    if n==1:
        return A
    //Reoccuring function//
    elif n>1:
        return recursion(A,n-1)

B. While
def while1(A,n):
    product,counter = A,n
    while counter >= 1:
        product = product + counter
        counter = counter - 1
    return product

def while2(A,n):
    product,counter = A,1
    while counter <= n:
        product = product + counter
        counter = counter + 1
    return product

def while3(A,n):
    //Initializing product and counter//
    product,counter = A,1
    //Setting condition for loop to continue and eventually stop//
    while counter <= n:
        //Reassigning product and counter to a new modified one with each step of the while loop. You can do almost anything to the product and counter.//
        product = product + counter
        counter = counter + 1
    //Returning final product//
    return product

C. For
def for (A,n):
    result = A
    for i in range ( n ):
        result = result + i
    return result

def for (A,n):
    //Initializing result//
    result = A
    //Run i = 0,1,2,...,n-1//
    for i in range ( n ):
        //Reassigning result to a new modified one with each step of the for loop. You can do almost anything to result.//
        result = result + i
    //Returning final result//
    return result
